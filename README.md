Since last year I made a decision to become a F2E. 

Also I am a football fan. So I intend to draw Football clubs' logo using CSS.

I know I don't have too much F2E skill. 

But my motto is "Harder, Luckier!".

I modified the Dortmund logo. The Dortmund logo has two words: "BVB" and "09". I think I can do this using persudo-elements.

So I divide them into "BB" and "V 09". I got problem here: the "V" and "09" have different font size. maybe I can use first-letter persudo element. But my ::before has position set to absolute. so first-letter becomes invalid.
